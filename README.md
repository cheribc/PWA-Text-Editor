# PWA-Text-Editor

## Description

This application is a single-page PWA text editor that runs in the user's browser. It was created by adding methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. It can be used to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection, to be retrieved from local storage for later use.
